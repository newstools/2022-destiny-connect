Editing DESTINY magazine surely counts as one of the highlights of my media career. From being a reader and admirer of the brand to now heading a team of writers and creatives who bring our readers inspirational content is a huge honour. In the previous issue, I asked readers to interact with us by sending through their ideas and suggestions, and the response has been fantastic. That way we will know what resonates with you because you have your finger on the pulse of what makes our country tick, who the powerhouses and changemakers are, and what issues you want us to write about. A magazine is not the vanity project of the editor. The calibre of a magazine is determined by the target audience, market forces such as advertisers and outlets, the content, and the  editorial and creative teams. You, the reader, are our most important asset. We will endeavour to bring you interviews with people you might not have read about before, who are driving change wherever they go. We will not talk about pie-in-the-sky lifestyle elements, we will seek out trends that are not just imaginable but also doable; we will engage with engaging contributors. If we are not, please email me: ingrid.jones@mikatekomedia.co.za. Till next time, Ingrid Jones & Legend Manqele.
